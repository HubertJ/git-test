A few things to help me on my way through this Git journey.

## Git & GitHub

In order to better understand what is going on with Git I am going to avoid using the GUI for a while. At least until I am comfortable with the basics. 

### Commands

Command | Description
--- | ---
git init | Creates a Git repository in the current directory
git add [FILENAME] | Stages the specified file so that the file can be commited
git commit | Commits everything that has been staged 
git diff --cached --name-only |  Displays a list of files that are currently staged and waiting to be commited

For a more detailed description of these commands remember to view the git help. 

    git init --help


### Websites

Website | Address | Description
--- | --- | --- 
GitHub Help | https://help.github.com/ | The GitHub help pages. 
Git Documentation | http://git-scm.com/documentation | The Git documentation pages

Emoji Cheat Sheet | http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/ | A website with a collection of emoji codes that I think can be used in GitHub markdown


## Bash

Coming from a Windows background I am going to need to practice my bash commands. 

### Commands

Windows | Bash | Description
--- | --- | ---
dir | ls | List the contents of the current directory
md | mkdir | Create a directory
move | mv -iv | Move or rename a directory
cls | clear | Clear the window

###### Disclaimer, kind of!

I personally find it a lot easier to remember something if I write it down at least once and tried to describe it in my own words. Therefore there is probably a lot of duplication of knowledge that is probably described much better elsewhere.

# git-test

A sandbox repository to allow me to test things on GitHub and Git before breaking any real repositories.

> Good news, everyone! My first commit worked. 


Now what?
---------

Now to try my second commit, learn some new Git commands and learn a little bit more about GitHub. Hopefully this will go at least as smooth as the last. :smiley:

Below is a list of things to try out as part of this commit. 

* Make a change to an existing file in the repository.
* Add a directory to the respository.
* Add a new file to the repository.
* Learn some GitHub Flavored Markdown. 



Very little code so far... 

Maybe the below will help with that :worried:

```c#

using System;

namespace HubertJ
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
      Console.ReadKey();
    }
  }
}

```

Random commit. 

***

The original README for this repository (minus the strikethrough) looked like:

~~Hello, World!~~

~~git-test will be the repository used for testing all things git-related.~~
